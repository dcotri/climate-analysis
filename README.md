Climate Analysis Toolkit
This is a set of python scripts designed to analyse climate datafiles.

If you're interested in collaborating, email me at d.f.cotriscau@soton.ac.uk.

TO install a copy of the toolkit, open a terminal and run:
git clone git@github.com:dcotri/climate-analysis.git

**This code is in development and not all features will work**
